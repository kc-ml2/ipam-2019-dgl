## Chintala
* forward autodiff: time O(n) <- time-space tradeoff -> backworkd autodiff: space O(n)
* PyTorch Geometric
  * includes over 60 graph kernel benchmark datasets
  * point clouds to a graph by generating a nearest neighbor graph
    * _any better way than using nearest neighbors to construct a graph from a point cloud?_
